excerpt: "We propose six principles to guide research on digital markets: (1) public information should be available for research, (2) independent research is needed to monitor and evaluate firm operations, (3) firms must facilitate the sharing of research-relevant data with external researchers, (4) firms should not block research findings, (5) institutions, in particular universities and journals, should protect researchers from legal risks, and (6) the academic community must play a role in safeguarding research ethics and integrity."
