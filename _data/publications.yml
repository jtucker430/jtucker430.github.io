  abstract: Recent advancements in the availability and sophistication of generative
    artificial intelligence has been accompanied by widespread concerns regarding
    the ability for the public to navigate the digital information environment, especially
    during social and political events. A growing consensus across policymakers, academics,
    and industry leaders has emerged around the need for applying labels communicating
    whether AI was used in content creation. Labeling as a media literacy strategy
    and policy intervention has gained momentum, but what impacts do synthetic content
    labels have on the public? We run two online experiments to measure the effect
    of content labeling on perceptions of political images—their perceived provenance,
    veracity, and engagement intention. We find that AI labels effectively communicate
    content provenance, significantly reducing perceived human involvement in image
    creation regardless of whether images were actually AI-generated.

    Drawing on an extensive cross-national survey data analysis, Pop-Eleches and Tucker
    demonstrate that communist legacies continue to shape citizens' political values,
    economic preferences, and social attitudes decades after the fall of the Berlin
    Wall. The book provides a systematic framework for understanding how historical
    legacies influence contemporary political behavior.

  abstract: Social media is used by millions of Americans to access news and politics.
    Yet there are no studies, to date, examining whether these behaviors systematically
    vary for those whose political incorporation process is distinct from those in
    the majority. We fill this void by examining how Latino online political activity
    compares to that of white Americans and the role of language in Latinos’ online
    political engagement. We hypothesize that Latino online political activity is
    comparable to whites. Moreover, given media reports suggesting that greater quantities
    of political misinformation are circulating on Spanish versus English-language
    social media, we expect reliance on Spanish-language social media for news predicts
    beliefs in inaccurate political narratives. Our survey findings, which we believe
    to be the largest original survey of the online political activity of Latinos
    and whites, reveal support for these expectations. Latino social media political
    activity, as measured by sharing/viewing news, talking about politics, and following
    politicians, is comparable to whites, both in self-reported and digital trace
    data. Latinos also turned to social media for news about COVID-19 more often than
    did whites. Finally, Latinos relying on Spanish-language social media usage for
    news predicts beliefs in election fraud in the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.

  abstract: 'How can one understand the spread of ideas across text data? This is
    a key measurement problem in sociological inquiry, from the study of how interest
    groups shape media discourse, to the spread of policy across institutions, to
    the diffusion of organizational structures and institution themselves. To study
    how ideas and narratives diffuse across text, we must first develop a method to
    identify whether texts share the same information and narratives, rather than
    the same broad themes or exact features. We propose a novel approach to measure
    this quantity of interest, which we call “narrative similarity,” by using large
    language models to distill texts to their core ideas and then compare the similarity
    of claims rather than of words, phrases, or sentences. The result is an estimand
    much closer to narrative similarity than what is possible with past relevant alternatives,
    including exact text reuse, which returns lexically similar documents; topic modeling,
    which returns topically similar documents; or an array of alternative approaches.
    We devise an approach to providing out-of-sample measures of performance (precision,
    recall, F1) and show that our approach outperforms relevant alternatives by a
    large margin. We apply our approach to an important case study: The spread of
    Russian claims about the development of a Ukrainian bioweapons program in U.S.
    mainstream and fringe news websites. While we focus on news in this application,
    our approach can be applied more broadly to the study of propaganda, misinformation,
    diffusion of policy and cultural objects, among other topics.'

    The relatively high rates of respondents’ ability to name a Trump policy that
    would make them better off suggests that the success of his campaign can be partly
    attributed to its ability to communicate memorable information. Our evidence also
    suggests that cable television informed voters: respondents exposed to higher
    levels of liberal news were more likely to be able to name Clinton policies, and
    voters exposed to higher levels of conservative news were more likely to name
    Trump policies; these effects hold even conditioning on respondents’ ideology
    and exposure to mainstream media. Our results demonstrate the advantages of using
    novel survey questions and provide additional insights into the 2016 campaign
    that challenge one part of the conventional narrative about the presumed non-importance

  abstract: Abstract Past research alerts to the increasingly unpleasant climate surrounding
    public debate on social media. Female politicians, in particular, are reporting
    serious attacks targeted at them. Yet, research offers inconclusive insights regarding
    the gender gap in online incivility. This paper aims to address this gap by comparing
    politicians with varying levels of prominence and public status in different institutional
    contexts. Using a machine learning approach for analyzing over 23 million tweets
    addressed to politicians in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United
    States, we find little consistent evidence of a gender gap in the proportion of
    incivility. However, more prominent politicians are considerably and consistently
    more likely than others to receive uncivil attacks. While prominence influences
    US male and female politicians’ probability to receive uncivil tweets the same
    way, women in our European sample receive incivility regardless of their status.
    Most importantly, the incivility varies in quality and across contexts, with women,
    especially in more plurality contexts, receiving more identity-based attacks than
    other politicians.

  abstract: There is scant quantitative research describing Nextdoor, the world's
    largest and most important hyperlocal social media network. Due to its localized
    structure, Nextdoor data are notoriously difficult to collect and work with. We
    build multiple datasets that allow us to generate descriptive analyses of the
    platform's offline contexts and online content. We first create a comprehensive
    dataset of all Nextdoor neighborhoods joined with U.S. Census data, which we analyze
    at the community-level (block-group). Our findings suggests that Nextdoor is primarily
    used in communities where the populations are whiter, more educated, more likely
    to own a home, and with higher levels of average income, potentially impacting
    the platform's ability to create new opportunities for social capital formation
    and citizen engagement. At the same time, Nextdoor neighborhoods are more likely
    to have active government agency accounts---and law enforcement agencies in particular---where
    offline communities are more urban, have larger nonwhite populations, greater
    income inequality, and higher average home values. We then build a convenience
    sample of 30 Nextdoor neighborhoods, for which we collect daily posts and comments
    appearing in the feed (115,716 posts and 163,903 comments), as well as associated
    metadata. Among the accounts for which we collected posts and comments, posts
    seeking or offering services were the most frequent, while those reporting potentially
    suspicious people or activities received the highest average number of comments.
    Taken together, our study describes the ecosystem of and discussion on Nextdoor,
    as well as introduces data for quantitatively studying the platform.

  abstract: Abstract Measuring the impact of online misinformation is challenging.
    Traditional measures, such as user views or shares on social media, are incomplete
    because not everyone who is exposed to misinformation is equally likely to believe
    it. To address this issue, we developed a method that combines survey data with
    observational Twitter data to probabilistically estimate the number of users both
    exposed to and likely to believe a specific news story. As a proof of concept,
    we applied this method to 139 viral news articles and find that although false
    news reaches an audience with diverse political views, users who are both exposed
    and receptive to believing false news tend to have more extreme ideologies. These
    receptive users are also more likely to encounter misinformation earlier than
    those who are unlikely to believe it. This mismatch between overall user exposure
    and receptive user exposure underscores the limitation of relying solely on exposure
    or interaction data to measure the impact of misinformation, as well as the challenge
    of implementing effective interventions. To demonstrate how our approach can address
    this challenge, we then conducted data-driven simulations of common interventions
    used by social media platforms. We find that these interventions are only modestly
    effective at reducing exposure among users likely to believe misinformation, and
    their effectiveness quickly diminishes unless implemented soon after misinformation’s
    initial spread. Our paper provides a more precise estimate of misinformation’s
    impact by focusing on the exposure of users likely to believe it, offering insights
    for effective mitigation strategies on social media.

  abstract: AbstractConsiderable scholarly attention has been paid to understanding
    belief in online misinformation1,2, with a particular focus on social networks.
    However, the dominant role of search engines in the information environment remains
    underexplored, even though the use of online search to evaluate the veracity of
    information is a central component of media literacy interventions3–5. Although
    conventional wisdom suggests that searching online when evaluating misinformation
    would reduce belief in it, there is little empirical evidence to evaluate this
    claim. Here, across five experiments, we present consistent evidence that online
    search to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles actually increases
    the probability of believing them. To shed light on this relationship, we combine
    survey data with digital trace data collected using a custom browser extension.
    We find that the search effect is concentrated among individuals for whom search
    engines return lower-quality information. Our results indicate that those who
    search online to evaluate misinformation risk falling into data voids, or informational
    spaces in which there is corroborating evidence from low-quality sources. We also
    find consistent evidence that searching online to evaluate news increases belief
    in true news from low-quality sources, but inconsistent evidence that it increases
    belief in true news from mainstream sources. Our findings highlight the need for
    media literacy programmes to ground their recommendations in empirically tested
    strategies and for search engines to invest in solutions to the challenges identified
    here.

  abstract: We study the effect of Facebook and Instagram access on political beliefs,
    attitudes, and behavior by randomizing a subset of 19,857 Facebook users and 15,585
    Instagram users to deactivate their accounts for 6 wk before the 2020 U.S. election.
    We report four key findings. First, both Facebook and Instagram deactivation reduced
    an index of political participation (driven mainly by reduced participation online).
    Second, Facebook deactivation had no significant effect on an index of knowledge,
    but secondary analyses suggest that it reduced knowledge of general news while
    possibly also decreasing belief in misinformation circulating online. Third, Facebook
    deactivation may have reduced self-reported net votes for Trump, though this effect
    does not meet our preregistered significance threshold. Finally, the effects of
    both Facebook and Instagram deactivation on affective and issue polarization,
    perceived legitimacy of the election, candidate favorability, and voter turnout
    were all precisely estimated and close to zero.

  abstract: AbstractWe present a method for estimating the ideology of political YouTube
    videos. The subfield of estimating ideology as a latent variable has often focused
    on traditional actors such as legislators, while more recent work has used social
    media data to estimate the ideology of ordinary users, political elites, and media
    sources. We build on this work to estimate the ideology of a political YouTube
    video. First, we start with a matrix of political Reddit posts linking to YouTube
    videos and apply correspondence analysis to place those videos in an ideological
    space. Second, we train a language model with those estimated ideologies as training
    labels, enabling us to estimate the ideologies of videos not posted on Reddit.
    These predicted ideologies are then validated against human labels. We demonstrate
    the utility of this method by applying it to the watch histories of survey respondents
    to evaluate the prevalence of echo chambers on YouTube in addition to the association
    between video ideology and viewer engagement. Our approach gives video-level scores
    based only on supplied text metadata, is scalable, and can be easily adjusted
    to account for changes in the ideological landscape.

  abstract: AbstractScientific evidence regularly guides policy decisions1, with behavioural
    science increasingly part of this process2. In April 2020, an influential paper3
    proposed 19 policy recommendations (‘claims’) detailing how evidence from behavioural
    science could contribute to efforts to reduce impacts and end the COVID-19 pandemic.
    Here we assess 747 pandemic-related research articles that empirically investigated
    those claims. We report the scale of evidence and whether evidence supports them
    to indicate applicability for policymaking. Two independent teams, involving 72
    reviewers, found evidence for 18 of 19 claims, with both teams finding evidence
    supporting 16 (89%) of those 18 claims. The strongest evidence supported claims
    that anticipated culture, polarization and misinformation would be associated
    with policy effectiveness. Claims suggesting trusted leaders and positive social
    norms increased adherence to behavioural interventions also had strong empirical
    support, as did appealing to social consensus or bipartisan agreement. Targeted
    language in messaging yielded mixed effects and there were no effects for highlighting
    individual benefits or protecting others. No available evidence existed to assess
    any distinct differences in effects between using the terms ‘physical distancing’
    and ‘social distancing’. Analysis of 463 papers containing data showed generally
    large samples; 418 involved human participants with a mean of 16,848 (median of
    1,699). That statistical power underscored improved suitability of behavioural
    science research for informing policy decisions. Furthermore, by implementing
    a standardized approach to evidence selection and synthesis, we amplify broader
    implications for advancing scientific evidence in policy formulation and prioritization.

  abstract: Does Facebook enable ideological segregation in political news consumption?
    We analyzed exposure to news during the US 2020 election using aggregated data
    for 208 million US Facebook users. We compared the inventory of all political
    news that users could have seen in their feeds with the information that they
    saw (after algorithmic curation) and the information with which they engaged.
    We show that (i) ideological segregation is high and increases as we shift from
    potential exposure to actual exposure to engagement; (ii) there is an asymmetry
    between conservative and liberal audiences, with a substantial corner of the news
    ecosystem consumed exclusively by conservatives; and (iii) most misinformation,
    as identified by Meta’s Third-Party Fact-Checking Program, exists within this
    homogeneously conservative corner, which has no equivalent on the liberal side.
    Sources favored by conservative audiences were more prevalent on Facebook’s news
    ecosystem than those favored by liberals.

    The chronological feed also affected exposure to content: The amount of political

    content classified as uncivil or containing slur words they saw decreased on Facebook,
    and the amount of content from moderate friends and sources with ideologically

  abstract: AbstractMany critics raise concerns about the prevalence of ‘echo chambers’
    on social media and their potential role in increasing political polarization.
    However, the lack of available data and the challenges of conducting large-scale
    field experiments have made it difficult to assess the scope of the problem1,2.
    Here we present data from 2020 for the entire population of active adult Facebook
    users in the USA showing that content from ‘like-minded’ sources constitutes the
    majority of what people see on the platform, although political information and
    news represent only a small fraction of these exposures. To evaluate a potential
    response to concerns about the effects of echo chambers, we conducted a multi-wave
    field experiment on Facebook among 23,377 users for whom we reduced exposure to
    content from like-minded sources during the 2020 US presidential election by about
    one-third. We found that the intervention increased their exposure to content
    from cross-cutting sources and decreased exposure to uncivil language, but had
    no measurable effects on eight preregistered attitudinal measures such as affective
    polarization, ideological extremity, candidate evaluations and belief in false
    claims. These precisely estimated results suggest that although exposure to content
    from like-minded sources on social media is common, reducing its prevalence during
    the 2020 US presidential election did not correspondingly reduce polarization
    in beliefs or attitudes.

  abstract: We studied the effects of exposure to reshared content on Facebook during
    the 2020 US election by assigning a random set of consenting, US-based users to
    feeds that did not contain any reshares over a 3-month period. We find that removing
    reshared content substantially decreases the amount of political news, including
    content from untrustworthy sources, to which users are exposed; decreases overall
    clicks and reactions; and reduces partisan news clicks. Further, we observe that
    removing reshared content produces clear decreases in news knowledge within the
    sample, although there is some uncertainty about how this would generalize to
    all users. Contrary to expectations, the treatment does not significantly affect
    political polarization or any measure of individual-level political attitudes.

    Using longitudinal survey data from US respondents linked to their Twitter feeds,
    we quantify the relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence
    campaign and attitudes and voting behavior in the 2016 US election. We demonstrate,
    first, that exposure to Russian disinformation accounts was heavily concentrated:
    only 1% of users accounted for 70% of exposures. Second, exposure was concentrated
    among users who strongly identified as Republicans. Third, exposure to the Russian
    influence campaign was eclipsed by content from domestic news media and politicians.
    Finally, we find no evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure to
    the Russian foreign influence campaign and changes in attitudes, polarization,
    or voting behavior. The results have implications for understanding the limits
    of election interference campaigns on social media.'

  abstract: AbstractMany large survey courses rely on multiple professors or teaching

    best practices, students with similar levels of conceptual understanding can receive
    widely varying assessments from different graders. We detail how this can occur
    and argue that it is an example of differential item functioning (or interpersonal
    incomparability), where graders interpret the same possible grading range differently.
    Using both actual assessment data from a large survey course in Comparative Politics
    and simulation methods, we show that the bias can be corrected by a small number
    of “bridging” observations across graders. We conclude by offering best practices
    for fair assessment in large survey courses.

    social media—to engage with policy debates? Due to previous data limitations,
    we lack systematic information about whether and how state legislators publicly
    discuss policy and how this behavior varies across contexts. Using Twitter data
    and state-of-the-art topic modeling techniques, we introduce a method to study
    state legislator policy priorities and apply the method to 15 US states in 2018.
    We show that we are able to accurately capture the policy issues discussed by
    state legislators with substantially more accuracy than existing methods. We then
    present initial findings that validate the method and speak to debates in the
    literature. The paper concludes by discussing promising avenues for future state
    politics research using this new approach.

    We find that the majority of users (60%) do not follow any political elites. Those
    who do follow in-group elite accounts at much higher rates than out-group accounts
    (90 versus 10%), share information from in-group elites 13 times more frequently

    elites, and exist regardless of users’ ideological extremity.'

    United States led to a historic attack on the Capitol on January 6th, 2021 and
    represents one of the greatest challenges to America's democratic institutions
    in over a century. Narratives of fraud and conspiracy theories proliferated over
    the fall of 2020, finding fertile ground across online social networks, although
    little is know about the extent and drivers of this spread. In this article, we
    show that users who were more skeptical of the election's legitimacy were more
    likely to be recommended content that featured narratives about the legitimacy
    of the election. Our findings underscore the tension between an "effective" recommendation
    system that provides users with the content they want, and a dangerous mechanism
    by which misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracies can find their way to
    those most likely to believe them.

    of transparency and free expression. We conducted a randomized field experiment
    evaluating the impact of source credibility labels embedded in users’ social feeds
    and search results pages. By combining representative surveys ( n = 3337) and
    digital trace data ( n = 968) from a subset of respondents, we provide a rare
    ecologically valid test of such an intervention on both attitudes and behavior.
    On average across the sample, we are unable to detect changes in real-world consumption
    of news from low-quality sources after 3 weeks. We can also rule out small effects
    on perceived accuracy of popular misinformation spread about the Black Lives Matter
    movement and coronavirus disease 2019. However, we present suggestive evidence
    of a substantively meaningful increase in news diet quality among the heaviest
    consumers of misinformation. We discuss the implications of our findings for scholars
    and practitioners.

    little is known about the causal effects of social media on ethnic outgroup attitudes.
    Through an experiment in Bosnia and Herzegovina where users refrained from Facebook
    usage during 1 wk of heightened identity salience, we find that—counter expectations—people
    who deactivated their accounts reported lower outgroup regard than the group that
    remained active, but this effect was likely conditional on the level of ethnic
    heterogeneity of respondents’ residence. Additionally, we replicate findings from
    a study on US users: Deactivation led to a decrease in news knowledge and suggestive
    improvements in subjective wellbeing. Our findings bring nuance to popular beliefs,
    frequently dichotomous and simplistic, of social media’s impact on societal dynamics.'

  abstract: Debates around the effectiveness of high-profile Twitter account suspensions
    and similar bans on abusive users across social media platforms abound. Yet we
    know little about the effectiveness of warning a user about the possibility of
    suspending their account as opposed to outright suspensions in reducing hate speech.
    With a pre-registered experiment, we provide causal evidence that a warning message
    can reduce the use of hateful language on Twitter, at least in the short term.
    We design our messages based on the literature on deterrence, and test versions
    that emphasize the legitimacy of the sender, the credibility of the message, and
    the costliness of being suspended. We find that the act of warning a user of the
    potential consequences of their behavior can significantly reduce their hateful
    language for one week. We also find that warning messages that aim to appear legitimate
    in the eyes of the target user seem to be the most effective. In light of these
    findings, we consider the policy implications of platforms adopting a more aggressive
    approach to warning users that their accounts may be suspended as a tool for reducing
    hateful speech online.

  abstract: 'AbstractA growing body of research explores the factors that affect when
    corrupt politicians are held accountable by voters. Most studies, however, focus
    on one or few factors in isolation, leaving incomplete our understanding of whether
    they condition each other. To address this, we embedded rich conjoint candidate
    choice experiments into surveys in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. We test the
    importance of two contextual factors thought to mitigate voters’ punishment of
    corrupt politicians: how widespread corruption is and whether it brings side benefits.
    Like other scholars, we find that corruption decreases candidate support substantially.
    But, we also find that information that corruption is widespread does not lessen
    the sanction applied against corruption, whereas information about the side benefits
    from corruption does, and does so to a similar degree as the mitigating role of
    permissible attitudes toward bribery. Moreover, those who stand to gain from these
    side benefits are less likely to sanction corruption.'

    We establish that, across multiple regions and time periods, interaction with
    social media is strongly conditioned by traditional bio-rhythmic or 'Circadian'
    patterns, and that in the United States, this pattern is itself further conditioned
    by the ideological bent of the user. Using a time series of these histories around
    the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, we show that external events of great significance
    can disrupt traditional social media activity patterns, and that this disruption
    can be significant.

  abstract: An emerging empirical regularity suggests that older people use and respond
    to social media very differently than younger people. Older people are the fastest-growing
    population of Internet and social media users in the US, and this heterogeneity
    will soon become central to online politics. However, many important experiments
    in this field have been conducted on online samples that do not contain enough
    older people to be useful to generalize to the current population of Internet
    users; this issue is more pronounced for studies that are even a few years old.
    In this paper, we report the results of replicating two experiments involving
    social media (specifically, Facebook) conducted on one such sample lacking older
    users (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk) using a source of online subjects which does
    contain sufficient variation in subject age. We add a standard battery of questions
    designed to explicitly measure digital literacy. We find evidence of significant
    treatment effect heterogeneity in subject age and digital literacy in the replication
    of one of the two experiments. This result is an example of limitations to generalizability
    of research conducted on samples where selection is related to treatment effect
    heterogeneity; specifically, this result indicates that Mechanical Turk should
    not be used to recruit subjects when researchers suspect treatment effect heterogeneity
    in age or digital literacy, as we argue should be the case for research on digital
    media effects.

    using two intervention strategies—attaching a warning label and blocking engagement
    with the tweet entirely. We find that while blocking engagement on certain tweets
    limited their diffusion, messages we examined with warning labels spread further
    on Twitter than those without labels. Additionally, the messages that had been
    blocked on Twitter remained popular on Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit, being
    posted more often and garnering more visibility than messages that had either
    been labeled by Twitter or received no intervention at all. Taken together, our
    results emphasize the importance of considering content moderation at the ecosystem
    level.

  abstract: Communist regimes were avowedly leftist authoritarian regimes, a relative
    rarity among autocracies. The growing literature on regime legacies would lead
    us to expect that postcommunist citizens would be more likely to exhibit “left-authoritarian”
    attitudes than their counterparts elsewhere. Finding that this is the case, we
    rely on 157 surveys from 88 countries to test if a living through Communism legacy
    model can account for this surplus of left-authoritarian attitudes. Employing
    both aggregate and micro-level analyses, we find strong support for the predictions
    of this model. Moving beyond previous legacy studies, we then test a variety of
    hypothesized mechanisms to explain how exposure to communist rule could have led
    to the regime congruent left-authoritarian attitudes. Of the mechanisms tested,
    greater state penetration of society is associated with a strong socialization
    effect and religious attendance—and in particular attending Catholic religious
    services—is associated with weaker socialization effects.

    prediction of classic party identification theory. While most research draws on
    data from the United States or studies of low‐salience issues, we exploit the
    unique opportunity presented by the 2013 Italian election, with the four major
    parties of a clear multiparty setting holding distinct positions on crucial issues
    of the campaign. Based on an experimental design, we test the impact of party
    cues on citizens'' preferences on high‐salience issues. The results are surprising:
    Despite a party system in flux (with relevant new parties) and a weakening of
    traditional party identities, we find large, significant partisan‐cueing effects
    in all the three experimental issues, and for voters of all the major Italian
    parties—both old and new, governmental and opposition, ideologically clear or
    ambiguous.'

    Agency (IRA) -- Russian 'trolls' -- during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
    We assess claims that the IRA sought either to (1) support Donald Trump or (2)
    sow discord among the U.S. public by analyzing hyperlinks contained in 108,781
    IRA tweets. Our results show that although IRA accounts promoted links to both
    sides of the ideological spectrum, 'conservative' trolls were more active than
    'liberal' ones. The IRA also shared content across social media platforms, particularly
    YouTube -- the second-most linked destination among IRA tweets.

    that followers of opinionated celebrities do not withhold engagement when entertainers
    become politically mobilized and do indeed often go negative. Political content
    from celebrities sometimes generated more engagement than typical lifestyle tweets,
    suggesting the cost of political speech on Twitter for celebrities is relatively
    low.

  abstract: Are legislators responsive to the priorities of the public? Research demonstrates
    a strong correspondence between the issues about which the public cares and the
    issues addressed by politicians, but conclusive evidence about who leads whom
    in setting the political agenda has yet to be uncovered. We answer this question
    with fine-grained temporal analyses of Twitter messages by legislators and the
    public during the 113th U.S. Congress. After employing an unsupervised method
    that classifies tweets sent by legislators and citizens into topics, we use vector
    autoregression models to explore whose priorities more strongly predict the relationship
    between citizens and politicians. We find that legislators are more likely to
    follow, than to lead, discussion of public issues, results that hold even after
    controlling for the agenda-setting effects of the media. We also find, however,
    that legislators are more responsive to their supporters than to the general public.

    with conservatives more likely to follow media and political accounts classified
    as left-leaning than the reverse. Overall we find no evidence for a strict characterization
    of echo chambers.

  abstract: Computational propaganda and the use of automated accounts in social media
    have recently become the focus of public attention, with alleged Russian government
    activities abroad provoking particularly widespread interest. However, even in
    the Russian domestic context, where anecdotal evidence of state activity online
    goes back almost a decade, no public systematic attempt has been made to dissect
    the population of Russian social media bots by their political orientation. We
    address this gap by developing a deep neural network classifier that separates
    pro-regime, anti-regime, and neutral Russian Twitter bots. Our method relies on
    supervised machine learning and a new large set of labeled accounts, rather than
    externally obtained account affiliations or orientation of elites. We also illustrate
    the use of our method by applying it to bots operating in Russian political Twitter
    from 2015 to 2017 and show that both pro- and anti-Kremlin bots had a substantial
    presence on Twitter.

    To do so, we uniquely link an original survey with respondents'' sharing activity

    this content was a relatively rare activity. Conservatives were more likely to
    share articles from fake news domains, which in 2016 were largely pro-Trump in

    age group.'

  abstract: ObjectiveMacro‐level studies have consistently found a connection between
    economic crises and support for far‐right parties. However, research on the micro
    foundations for this electoral support has generally found little or no correlation
    between an individual's economic environment and far‐right voting. We test one
    possible explanation for this seeming paradox, namely, that determinants of far‐right
    identification differ across time and particularly in times of crisis.MethodsUtilizing
    traditional representative data from Eurobarometer surveys in a manner that strips
    away confounding issues generally found in the extant literature, we directly
    test whether individuals concerned about their personal economic situation, or
    that of their country, are more likely to identify with far‐right ideological
    beliefs during economic crises.ResultsUltimately, we find little evidence to support
    the claim that the Great Recession of 2007–2009 and its aftermath shifted the
    determinants of support for far‐right ideology, though prospective pocketbook
    concerns do increase the likelihood of identifying with the far right.ConclusionsWe
    discuss the implications of these findings and offer additional avenues for future
    research.

  doi: 10.1111/pops.12480

  abstract: What factors enable and motivate citizens to form partisan identities?
    Popular accounts, as well as several major theoretical approaches, attribute a
    central role for policy and ideological concerns in shaping the partisan orientations
    of voters. Information about the policy aims of parties should therefore, on average,
    make it easier for an individual to find a party that best fits her views, especially
    if she had previously been less familiar with the parties. The evidence for this
    is mixed, however. Plenty of studies find a robust correlation between policy
    views and partisanship. Yet there is mounting evidence that citizens look to parties
    to decide where to stand on policy issues, suggesting that partisan identification
    precedes policy preferences. We bring new evidence to bear by investigating directly
    the impact of substantive policy information on the partisan identities of ordinary
    citizens. To do this, we carry out a pair of original experiments across six countries,
    five of which are relatively young or unstable party systems. One experiment informs
    citizens about the policy goals of the major parties; we find little to no evidence
    that such information affects levels of partisanship. The other experiment tests
    the impact of inviting citizens to evaluate and compare their own position to
    the positions of the major parties, a more direct test of the sort of reasoning
    posited in some theoretical accounts. We find that this reflective task in fact
    depresses levels of partisanship, perhaps especially among those who knew less
    about politics and parties from the outset. This suggests that thinking about
    policy differences and proximities pushes citizens away from partisan attachments
    they form in the ordinary course of life, perhaps because such thinking generates
    fresh doubts or focuses attention on facets of partisan choice that matter less
    in typical processes of preference formation.

  abstract: Academics and policymakers recognize that there are serious costs associated
    with systemic corruption. Stubbornly, many countries or regions remain stuck in
    a high-corruption equilibrium—a “corruption trap.” Most existing theories concentrate
    on mutually reinforcing expectations of corrupt behavior among a fixed set of
    bureaucrats or politicians, implying that changing such expectations can lead
    to lower corruption. We develop models that more fully characterize thepoliticalnature
    of corruption traps by also analyzing the behavior of voters and entrants to politics,
    as well their interaction with incumbent politicians. We show that corruption
    traps can arise through strategic behavior of each set of actors, as well as through
    their interrelations. By linking politician, voter, and entrant behavior, we provide
    an explanation for why simply trying to change expectations among one set of actors
    is likely insufficient for eliminating corruption traps.

    methods of textual analysis to investigate value-laden language in a collection
    of 577,555 messages sent from the public Twitter accounts of over 400 members
    of the U.S. Congress between 2012 and 2014. Consistent with theoretical expectations,
    we observed that Republican and conservative legislators stressed values of tradition,
    conformity, and national security (as well as self-direction), whereas Democratic
    and liberal legislators stressed values of benevolence, universalism, hedonism,
    and social/economic security (as well as achievement).

    in measuring public opinion. It first considers the opportunities and challenges
    that are involved in conducting public opinion surveys using social media data.
    Three challenges are discussed: identifying political opinion, representativeness
    of social media users, and aggregating from individual responses to public opinion.
    The chapter outlines some of the strategies for overcoming these challenges and
    proceeds by highlighting some of the novel uses for social media that have fewer
    direct analogs in traditional survey work.'

  abstract: Automated and semiautomated Twitter accounts, bots, have recently gained
    significant public attention due to their potential interference in the political
    realm. We develop detection methodology using multiple classifiers to study bot
    activity in Russian political discussions from February 2014 to December 2015.
    We discover that bots produced over 50% of tweets about Russian politics during
    this period, and were primarily used for sharing news headlines and promoting
    media outlets, suggesting their main purpose was manipulating search rankings.

  abstract: Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in
    online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study
    of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more
    rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion
    is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks,
    a process we call 'moral contagion.' Using a large sample of social media communications
    about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that
    the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by
    a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion
    was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion
    more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them.

    received 1,000 comments, would have a much larger impact on subsequent political
    developments than most that had preceded it. The protests eventually became the
    largest since Ukrainian independence, ultimately leading to government resignation,
    presidential exile, and the Crimean conflict.

    from late 2013 through 2014 during the Euromaidan crisis and find no evidence
    that major political events triggered language preference reversals. Notably,
    both Ukrainian and Russian speakers increased their Russian-language usage after
    Crimea's annexation.

  abstract: The article examines the relationship between corruption and voting behavior
    by defining two distinct channels:pocketbook corruption voting, i.e. how personal
    experiences with corruption affect voting behavior; andsociotropic corruption
    voting, i.e. how perceptions of corruption in society do so. Individual and aggregate
    data from Slovakia fail to support hypotheses that corruption is an undifferentiated
    valence issue, that it depends on the presence of a viable anti-corruption party,
    or that voters tolerate (or even prefer) corruption, and support the hypothesis
    that the importance of each channel depends on thesalienceof each source of corruption
    and that pocketbook corruption voting prevails unless a credible anti-corruption
    party shifts media coverage of corruption and activates sociotropic corruption
    voting. Previous studies may have underestimated the prevalence of corruption
    voting by not accounting for both channels.

    themselves from viewpoints with which they disagree, thereby serving as political
    'echo chambers.' We examine Twitter users during the 2013 German and Italian elections,
    finding that exposure to different political viewpoints depends on offline conversation
    patterns and habits of social media political engagement.

  abstract: Social media have provided instrumental means of communication in many
    recent political protests. The efficiency of online networks in disseminating
    timely information has been praised by many commentators; at the same time, users
    are often derided as 'slacktivists' because of the shallow commitment involved
    in clicking a forwarding button. We find that peripheral participants are critical
    in increasing the reach of protest messages and generating online content at levels
    that are comparable to core participants.

    electoral volatility into two components: volatility caused by new party entry
    and old party exit, and volatility caused by vote switching across existing parties.
    After providing an overview of both types of volatility in post-communist countries,
    the causes of volatility are analysed using a larger dataset than those used in
    previous studies. The results are startling: most findings based on elections
    in post-communist countries included in previous studies disappear. Instead, entry
    and exit volatility is found to be largely a function of long-term economic recovery,
    and it becomes clear that very little is known about what causes ‘party switching’
    volatility. As a robustness test of this latter result, the authors demonstrate
    that systematic explanations for party-switching volatility in Western Europe
    can indeed be found.'

  abstract: 'Political parties not only aggregate the policy preferences of their
    supporters, but also have the ability to shape those preferences. Experimental
    evidence demonstrates that, when parties stake out positions on policy issues,
    partisans become more likely to adopt these positions, whether out of blind loyalty
    or because they infer that party endorsements signal options consistent with their
    interests or values. It is equally clear, however, that partisans do not always
    follow their party’s lead. The authors investigate the impact of three party-level
    traits on partisan cue taking: longevity, incumbency, and ideological clarity.
    As parties age, voters may become more certain of both the party’s reputation
    and their own allegiance. Governing parties must take action and respond to events,
    increasing the likelihood of compromise and failure, and therefore may dilute
    their reputation and disappoint followers. Incumbency aside, some parties exhibit
    greater ambiguity in their ideological position than other parties, undermining
    voter certainty about the meaning of cues. The authors test these hypotheses with
    experiments conducted in three multiparty democracies (Poland, Hungary, and Great
    Britain). They find that partisans more strongly follow their party’s lead when
    that party is older, in the opposition, or has developed a more consistent ideological
    image. However, the impact of longevity vanishes when the other factors are taken
    into account. Underscoring the importance of voter (un)certainty, ideologically
    coherent opposition parties have the greatest capacity to shape the policy views
    of followers.'

  abstract: 'In the aftermath of the Arab Spring, a crucial question is whether popular
    protest is now likely to be a permanent part of Middle Eastern politics or if
    the protests that have taken place over the past two years are more likely to
    be a “one‐shot deal.” We consider this question from a theoretical perspective,
    focusing on the relationship between the consequences of protests in one period
    and the incentives to protest in the future. The model provides numerous predictions
    for why we might observe a phenomenon that we call the “one‐shot deal”: when protest
    occurs at one time but not in the future despite an intervening period of bad
    governance. The analysis focuses on the learning process of citizens. We suggest
    that citizens may not only be discovering the type or quality of their new government—as
    most previous models of adverse selection assume—but rather citizens may also
    be learning about the universe of potential governments in their country. In this
    way, bad performance by one government induces some pessimism about possible replacements.
    This modeling approach expands the formal literature on adverse selection in elections
    in two ways: it takes seriously the fact that removing governments can be costly,
    and it explores the relevance of allowing the citizen/principal to face uncertainty
    about the underlying distribution from which possible government/agent types are
    drawn.'

  abstract: 'In this article, we test the effect of communist-era legacies on the
    large and temporally resilient deficit in civic participation in post-communist
    countries. To do so, we analyze data from 157 surveys conducted between 1990 and
    2009 in twenty-four post-communist countries and forty-two non-post-communist
    countries. The specific hypotheses we test are drawn from a comprehensive theoretical
    framework of the effects of communist legacies on political behavior in post-communist
    countries that we have previously developed. Our analysis suggests that three
    mechanisms were particularly salient in explaining this deficit: first, the demographic
    profile (including lower religiosity levels) of post-communist countries is less
    conducive to civic participation than elsewhere. Second, the magnitude of the
    deficit increases with the number of years an individual spent under communism
    but the effects were particularly strong for people socialized in the post-totalitarian
    years and for those who experienced communism in their early formative years (between
    ages six and seventeen). Finally, we also find that civic participation suffered
    in countries that experienced weaker economic performance in the post-communist
    period, though differences in post-communist democratic trajectories had a negligible
    impact on participation. Taken together, we leave behind a potentially optimistic
    picture about civic society in post-communist countries, as the evidence we present
    suggests eventual convergence toward norms in other non post-communist countries.'

  abstract: 'One of the most interesting features of the 2003 Polish referendum on
    European Union (EU) membership was the strong link between voting behaviour in
    the 2003 referendum and voting behaviour in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election.
    In this article, we test two competing mechanisms that could account for this
    finding: a responsible party model, whereby citizens’ attitudes towards EU membership
    would have been driven by their preferred party’s position on the issue, and a
    more Downsian model, whereby the existence of an unrepresented Polish Eurosceptic
    electorate could have driven the success of two new Eurosceptic parties in the
    2001 parliamentary elections. Drawing upon data from the 1997, 2001 and 2005 Polish
    National Election Studies, we find much stronger empirical support for the Downsian
    approach. Far from being led to their Euroscepticism by party leaders as the 2003
    referendum on Polish EU membership approached, voters for Poland’s Eurosceptic
    parties in 2001 already possessed healthy degrees of Euroscepticism, especially
    when compared to supporters of other parties and even to non-voters.'

  abstract: We consider the question of whether Russia's greatly weakened political
    parties might continue to exert an influence on public opinion in twenty‐first
    century Russia. To do so, we carried out a series of survey‐based experiments
    in Moscow in the spring of 2006. We present evidence showing that partisan cues
    increase support for public policy proposals and make it more likely that respondents
    will adopt a position on an issue that mirrors their party's preferred position
    (“opinion taking”), as well as increase the likelihood that respondents will adopt
    a position on a given issue at all (“opinion giving”). We also present evidence
    that party cues can sway the opinions of nonpartisans, though such influence may
    be limited to cases when the position of a party constitutes an unusually informative
    or credible signal. The findings should be of interest to those concerned with
    Russia's post‐communist political development, those interested more broadly in
    the effects of partisan cues on political behavior, as well as to scholars trying
    to characterize the nature of “competitive authoritarian” regimes.Consideramos
    la cuestión de si partidos políticos fuertemente debilitados, como es el caso
    de los partidos rusos, podrían continuar influyendo la opinión pública en la Rusia
    del siglo XXI. Para responder esto llevamos a cabo una serie de investigaciones
    basadas en encuestas realizadas en Moscú en la primavera de 2006. Presentamos
    evidencia que demuestra que las pautas partidistas incrementan el apoyo del público
    a sus propuestas de políticas y hacen más probable que un encuestado conozca la
    preferencia del partido e incluso la llegue a asumir como suya (“tomando opinión”),
    así como que incremente la posibilidad de que ellos adopten una determinada posición
    sobre un determinado tópico (“dando opinión”). También presentamos evidencia que
    las pautas del partido pueden producir cambios de opinión, aunque dicha influencia
    puede estar limitada a casos donde la posición del partido constituye una señal
    inusualmente informativa o creíble. Los resultados serán de interés para aquellos
    preocupados por el desarrollo político de Rusia post‐comunista, aquellos interesados
    más ampliamente en los efectos de las pautas partidistas en el comportamiento
    político, así como para los académicos que buscan precisar las características
    de los regímenes “autoritarios competitivos.”

  abstract: Automated text classification has rapidly become an important tool for
    political analysis. Recent advancements in NLP enabled by advances in deep learning
    now achieve state of the art results in many standard tasks for the field. However,
    these methods require large amounts of both computing resources and text data
    to learn the characteristics of the language, resources which are not always accessible
    to political scientists. One solution is a transfer learning approach. We investigate
    the performance of these models in political science by comparing multiple text
    classification methods. We find RoBERTa and XLNet, language models that rely on
    the Transformer, require fewer computing resources and less training data to perform
    on par with -- or outperform -- several political science text classification
    methods.

  abstract: The role of the media in influencing people's attitudes and opinions is
    difficult to demonstrate because media consumption by survey respondents is usually
    unobserved in datasets containing information on attitudes and vote choice. This
    paper leverages behavioral data combined with responses from a multi-wave panel
    to test whether Democrats who see more stories from liberal news sources on Twitter
    develop more liberal positions over time and, conversely, whether Republicans
    are more likely to revise their views in a conservative direction if they are
    exposed to more news on Twitter from conservative media sources. We find evidence
    that exposure to ideologically framed information and arguments changes voters'
    own positions, but has a limited impact on perceptions of where the candidates
    stand on the issues.

  abstract: Two randomized experiments conducted before the 2020 U.S. election examined
    social media deactivation effects. Deactivating Facebook for six weeks before
    the election produced a 0.060 standard deviation improvement in an index of happiness,
    depression, and anxiety. Instagram deactivation showed similar but smaller gains
    (0.041 SD). Effects varied by demographics, with Facebook benefits concentrated
    among those 35+, while Instagram benefits concentrated among women under 25.

  title: How Reliance on Spanish-Language Social Media Predicts Beliefs in False Political
    Narratives Amongst Latinos
  authors: Abrajano, Marisa A., Marianna Garcia, Aaron Pope, Robert Vidigal, Joshua
    A. Tucker, and Jonathan Nagler
  year: 2024
  venue: PNAS Nexus
  volume_issue_pages: 3(11)
  doi: 10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae442
  type: journal_article
  abstract: Conducted a large-scale survey examining social media usage and misinformation
    beliefs among Latino populations around the 2022 midterm elections. Latinos who
    use Spanish-language social media have a higher probability of believing in false
    political narratives, compared with Latinos using English-language social media.
    Latinos face heightened misinformation vulnerability due to greater reliance on
    social media, weaker Spanish-language fact-checking algorithms, and less platform
    enforcement against Spanish-language falsehoods.

    of Texts with Large Language Models

  type: journal_article
  abstract: Presents a framework using generative LLMs for text scoring that addresses
    limitations of existing methods. The approach, called concept-guided chain-of-thought
    (CGCoT), employs researcher-designed prompts with an LLM to generate a concept-specific
    breakdown for each text. Applied to measure political party aversion on Twitter,
    achieves stronger performance than unsupervised methods like Wordfish, with results
    comparable to supervised fine-tuned models while requiring minimal hand-labeled
    data.

  abstract: Conducted pre-registered experiments to measure how additional information
    affects people's ability to identify accurate versus false news in real time.
    Access to the full article relative to solely the headline/lede and access to
    source information improves an individual's ability to correctly discern the veracity
    of news. Encouraging online searches increased belief in both true and false content.

  abstract: Replicated a 2021 Facebook deactivation study in Cyprus to examine social
    media's impact on interethnic polarization. While they could not reproduce the
    main effect found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, they identified a significant interaction
    pattern. The study also confirmed that Facebook deactivation leads to a reduction
    in anxiety levels and provided suggestive evidence of reduced news knowledge.

    data for measuring ideologies of audiences for web domains. Examines metrics for
    ideological positioning and tests their robustness when privacy-preserving noise
    is introduced. Using Facebook engagement data, validated approach against prior
    work, achieving correlations exceeding 0.87. Viewing audiences tend toward more
    moderate positions than sharing audiences.

  doi: 10.1017/S0003055421001507
  type: journal_article
  abstract: There is abundant anecdotal evidence that nondemocratic regimes are harnessing
    new digital technologies known as social media bots to facilitate policy goals.
    The study develops theoretical frameworks predicting bot deployment in response
    to either offline or online protest activities. Using Twitter data from Russian
    pro-government bots (2015-2018), found that online opposition activities produce
    stronger reactions from bots than offline protests. Bots amplify messaging through
    increased posting and retweeting during opposition mobilization.
