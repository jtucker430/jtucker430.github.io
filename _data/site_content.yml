  publisher: Cambridge University Press
  description: Social media platforms have become a major channel for political communication,

  title: 'Communism''s Shadow: Historical Legacies and Contemporary Political Attitudes'
  authors: Grigore Pop-Eleches and Joshua A. Tucker
  year: 2017
  publisher: Princeton University Press
  series: Princeton Studies in Political Behavior
  description: "It has long been assumed that the historical legacy of Soviet Communism\
    \ would have an important effect on post-communist states. However, prior research\
    \ has focused primarily on the institutional legacy of communism. Communism's\
    \ Shadow instead turns the focus to the individuals who inhabit post-communist\
    \ countries, presenting a rigorous assessment of the legacy of communism on political\
    \ attitudes.\n\n Post-communist citizens hold political, economic, and social\
    \ opinions that consistently differ from individuals in other countries. Grigore\
    \ Pop-Eleches and Joshua Tucker introduce two distinct frameworks to explain these\
    \ differences, the first of which focuses on the effects of living in a post-communist\
    \ country, and the second on living through communism. Drawing on large-scale\
    \ research encompassing post-communist states and other countries around the globe,\
    \ the authors demonstrate that living through communism has a clear, consistent\
    \ influence on why citizens in post-communist countries are, on average, less\
    \ supportive of democracy and markets and more supportive of state-provided social\
    \ welfare. The longer citizens have lived through communism, especially as adults,\
    \ the greater their support for beliefs associated with communist ideology—the\
    \ one exception being opinions regarding gender equality."

  description: This book examines the effect of economic conditions on election results
    in five post-communist countries--Russia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech
    Republic--in the first decade of post-communist elections. It is the first book
    length study of economic voting outside of established democracies, as well as
    one of the few comparative studies of voting in post-communist countries generally.
    The study relies on an original database composed of regional level economic,
    demographic, and electoral data, and the analysis features a broadly based comparative
    assessment of the findings across all twenty elections as well as more focused
    case study analysis.
